# Lisp-Interpreter
Very basic version of Lisp Interpreter designed as a part of homework of CSE 6341: Programming Langauges

## Part 1
Implementation of the front-end of the Lisp Interpreter which deals with an input handler and an output handler. The Input handler should be able to identify multiline S-expressions which can be a mixture of dot `.` and list notation. Part 1 has to read multiple s-expression with mixed notation and output the dot-notation of the input.
